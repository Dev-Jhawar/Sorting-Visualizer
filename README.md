# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer – Java

A dynamic and educational **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **Java**. This project illustrates how various sorting algorithms work under the hood through step-by-step visual outputs, helping learners and developers understand sorting logic in action.

> 🚀 Designed with simplicity, clarity, and algorithmic learning in mind.
